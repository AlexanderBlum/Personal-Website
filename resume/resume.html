	<h2> PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE </h2>
	
	<h3> Research Assistant - UNC Charlotte Mechanical Engineering (May 2015-Present) </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Develop test methodology, instrumentation systems, and experiments to quantify wear mechanisms of single point diamond turning </li>
		<li>Designed optical instrumentation for infrared measurement of cutting tool temperature, and high-speed imaging of the chip during orthogonal turning </li>
		<li>Developed LabVIEW code for data collection and preliminary analysis and MATLAB code to analyze results, including numerical methods for processing and aligning interferometer data from multiple measurements. Created detailed documentation for the analysis process </li>
		<li>Uncertainty analysis of tool wear measurement process using Monte Carlo approach. Reduced measurement uncertainty from 15 nm to 5 nm </li>
		<li>Developed framework for characterizing the limits of measurement systems when measuring freeform optical surfaces</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h3> ASPE Student Challenge – UNC Charlotte  Design Team  (2018 and 2019) </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1st place for two consecutive years </li>
		<li>Small team developed confocal microscope for measuring Gorilla Glass (2018) and Kibble Balance for realization of the kilogram (2019) </li>
		<li>Implemented open and closed-loop controllers for both projects with LabVIEW FPGA </li>
		<li>Created dynamic model of systems analytically and using HP Dynamic Signal analyzer. Used both models to improve damping and natural frequency of designs </li>
	</ul>	

	<h3> Precision Eng. Intern – Lawrence Livermore National Lab  (May 2017-August 2017) </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Measured and corrected stage flatness for direct ink write 3-D printers. Wrote MATLAB code to partially automate this process and refactored the controller-based calibration program to reduce cycle time by 50 percent </li>
		<li>Developed and analyzed a series of thermal sensitivity experiments for printers, worked with machine learning group to develop temperature-displacement model </li>
		<li>Several concurrent machine design or analysis projects as needed, such as more compact brackets for printer actuators and seismic analysis of 3-D printer tables </li>
	</ul>	
		
	<h3> Senior Design – Device for Micro Patterning Freeform Optics (August 2015-May 2016) </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Small team designed device to produce periodic structures on freeform surfaces </li>
		<li>Project attempted to disrupt current optics technology by tracing structured surfaces onto freeforms with process derived from atomic force microscopy </li>
		<li>Used SolidWorks to develop FEA, MATLAB for uncertainty analysis of flexure </li>
		<li>●	Developed controls w/MATLAB and Simulink, implemented closed-loop control using MyRIO microcontroller </li>		
	</ul>		
		
	<h2> LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE </h2>
