	The designs below are both driven by voice coils. These are a type of linear motor that uses the Lorentz force to drive a stage.
	Voice coil actuators are frictionless, have negligible hysteresis, and can be used to position a stage with extremely high precision.
	Displacement can be up to several inches, and force generated ranges from ounces to hundreds of pounds. 
	The coil used in these designs has a peak force of 9~lbf and maximum displacement of $\pm$ 0.12~inches. 
	There are multiple common designs but all of them operate on the same basic principles. 
	Shown here is a 'moving coil' design.
	</p>
	<h4 id="vc_theory"><a href="#vc_theory_toc">1.1 Theory of Operation</a></h4>
	<p>
	The stationary assembly consists of a magnet mounted on a ferrous cup that helps guide the magnetic field. 
	The moving assembly is a length of wire (the coil) tightly wound around a plastic 'spool'. 
	Current travels through the wire perpendicular to the magnetic field, 
	producing a force that acts on the moving assembly according to the formula \(\vec{F} = \vec{I}l \times \vec{B}\),
	where \(\vec{F}\) is the force produced,  \(\vec{B}\) is the magnetic field strength, 
	current in the wire is \(\vec{I}\), and \(l\) is the total length of wire. 
	These relationships are shown in the first two figures.
	</p>
	<p>
	In this formula the magnetic field and wire length terms are fixed, 
	so the only way we can vary the actuator force is by changing the current going into the wire. 
	The simplest way to do this is with power transistors, or a power operational amplifier. 
	These designs use a Texas Instruments OPA549SG3 power op amp to create an output current directly proportional to an input current. 
	The design used is shown in Figure X. Current output for this circuit design is $$i = \frac{R_2}{R_5 (R_1+R_2)} V_i$$

	The voice coil can also be analyzed as an electro-mechanical system consisting of an RLC circuit and spring-mass damper.
	This will be done below after discussing the flexure assembly.

	<h4 id="vc_circuit"><a href="#vc_circuit_toc">1.2 Driving Circuit</a></h4>
	Two displacement sensors were used in these projects: 
	<h3 id="disp_sensors"><a href="#disp_sensors_toc">2. Displacement Sensors</a></h3>
	<p>
	Lion Precision capacitance probes and homebrew knife-edge sensors.
	Capacitance probes use the definition of a classical parallel-plate capacitor, \(C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}\), 
	as a tool for measuring displacement. \(A\) is the sensor area, \(epsilon\) is the dielectric constant, 
	and \(d\) is the distance between plates. This equation does not address the effects of stray capacitance, 
	second-order effects, and other deviations from the ideal model. 
	A guard electrode is used to deal with stray capacitance and collimate the electric field lines between probe and target, 
	making the probe behave more closely to an ideal parallel plate capacitor (Figure). 
	From the equation we can see that larger sensors will create greater changes in capacitance for a given distance. 
	We are measuring distance indirectly via capacitance, so a quality calibration is important. 
	For this application the dielectric is air and \(\epsilon\) is a function of temperature, pressure, and humidity. 
	If an application is extremely high precision this must be accounted for.
	A well-designed capacitance sensor system will have a resolution of single-digit nanometers or better. 
	This is not the precision of the system - linearity, noise, environmental effects, 
	and misalignment must all be considered when evaluating measurement uncertainty. 
	The extremely high resolution and non-contact nature of capacitance probes makes the ideal for closed loop control of short travel micro-positioning systems. 
	The probes used here have a range of 500~\textmu m and resolution of 10~nm at 15~kHz.
